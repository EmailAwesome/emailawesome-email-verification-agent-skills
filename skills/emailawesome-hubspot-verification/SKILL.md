# Automatically Verify New HubSpot Leads Before Outreach

Create a reversible HubSpot and EmailAwesome workflow that makes uncertainty visible before downstream outreach.

## Workflow

1. Identify the HubSpot trigger, form or object, source email field, stable record ID, current consent/suppression fields, and the first downstream action that depends on verification.
2. Read the [shared EmailAwesome guidance](https://github.com/EmailAwesome/emailawesome-email-verification-agent-skills/tree/main/skills/emailawesome) and [references/hubspot-zapier-workflow.md](references/hubspot-zapier-workflow.md).
3. Choose Realtime Email Validation when the next Zap step needs an immediate branch. Use saved single validation when an asynchronous record is acceptable; use bulk verification for existing exports.
4. Map all four results explicitly. Never create a `RISKY` pseudo-status or merge `CATCH_ALL` and `UNKNOWN` into `VALID`.
5. Add duplicate-trigger protection, verification timestamp, provider result, provider/job ID where available, workflow version, retry owner, and an exception queue.
6. Produce a dry-run map of every read, write, branch, failure path, and rollback step.
7. Test valid, invalid, catch-all, unknown, missing email, malformed input, duplicate trigger, provider outage, and downstream-write failure.
8. Require approval immediately before enabling the Zap, changing a live workflow, backfilling records, or writing to HubSpot.

## Boundaries

- This is a Zapier workflow, not a proprietary native HubSpot connector.
- A HubSpot form submission may already exist before validation. Say `verify before outreach or downstream use`, not `prevent HubSpot from creating the contact`.
- Never delete contacts or overwrite consent automatically.

## Product account dependency

For browser operation, install the `emailawesome` product skill from https://github.com/EmailAwesome/emailawesome-email-verification-agent-skills and follow its account and capacity journey. If it is not installed, read the linked product instructions and current documentation; never assume sibling skill folders exist.

For jurisdiction-specific outreach preparation, consult the current [FTC commercial email guidance](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business) and [ICO B2B marketing guidance](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/direct-marketing-and-privacy-and-electronic-communications/business-to-business-marketing/) when applicable. Verify other recipient jurisdictions separately; these references are not universal legal clearance.
