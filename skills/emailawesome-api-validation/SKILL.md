# Add Email Validation to Forms and Lead Pipelines with an API

Build a production-oriented verification boundary without exposing secrets or losing asynchronous results.

## Workflow

1. Define the entry point, latency tolerance, stable internal request ID, retention, failure policy, and permitted next action for every result.
2. Read the [shared EmailAwesome guidance](../emailawesome/SKILL.md) and [references/async-validation-contract.md](references/async-validation-contract.md). Recheck current developer documentation before generating deployable transport code.
3. Keep `x-api-key` server-side. Persist the internal request before provider submission and retain the returned provider ID.
4. Use a public HTTPS callback with strict method, content type, size, schema, authenticity, replay, and destination controls. Do not allow end users to choose arbitrary callback URLs or headers.
5. Apply terminal events idempotently and tolerate duplicate or out-of-order callbacks. Keep provider job state separate from verification result and business decision.
6. Use bounded backoff for rate limits and transient failures. Do not blindly retry malformed requests, unresolved conflicts, or an uncertain submission that may consume another credit.
7. Run `scripts/reconcile_jobs.py` to detect missing, unexpected or duplicate source mappings and to distinguish mapping completion from terminal email results. A mapped pending job is not a completed verification.
8. Test all four results, provider outage, timeout, malformed callback, replay, duplicate callback, out-of-order delivery, and unauthorized callback.
9. Require explicit authorization before deployment, enabling blocking behavior, or connecting production data.
